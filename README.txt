About this project:
It is a python Pacage to perform physics calculation.We use various physics formula to solve problem.By python pacage you can perform various
physic operation easily.

How to install:
pip install PhysicsNutshell

How to use with example:
Suppose you want to find speed then write:
import physicsNutshell 
print(physicsNutshell.physics.kinematics.find_speed_using_s_t(distance,time))
